# Planning Common

A Java library to simplify the implementation of automated planning algorithms and associated parsers. It also includes
a collection of planning domain and problem examples for testing purposes.

## Why?

This library was created to reduce the effort involved in creating a new planner or parser implementation. By using
the model classes provided here and implementing the parser or planner interfaces defined in this project, developers
can focus on the planning algorithm itself rather than reinventing the wheel.

## Contribute

Contributions are gratefully received. There are a number of ways you can help:

### Examples

We need plenty of domain and problem examples for testing parsers and planners. If you have any examples that will
extend test coverage, please send them through.

### Bugs

Please raise bug reports as issues on GitHub, preferably with sample code or PDDL files to reproduce. Pull requests to
fix are welcome.

### Features

If you'd like to request a feature, please raise an issue on GitHub. If you want to work on developing a feature
yourself you're very welcome, but it would be best to raise an issue and discuss first.
